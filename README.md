## Job Vacancy Preview

This is a web page that has been written in ReactJS, and it lists job vacancies from all over the world.

The results can be filtered by keywords - about the job title or the company name, the location, and whether or not the contract is fulltime.

The icons are imported from [react-feather](https://github.com/feathericons/react-feather), [react-hook-form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form) is also used for the form. All the styles are in pure SCSS.


To run the project run the command below:

```
$ npm install

$ npm run start
```
